# SecretsApp_Nodejs_Express_EJS_Postgre_HASH_SALT_Commit_History WORK IN PROGRESS

## Description
Secrets app is a solution created with the Express framework and Node.js, includin PostgreSQL as a database.

With this project I aim to develope understanding of how to integrate authentication to web projects, how to integrate database into web projects and how to use Express/Node.js for server-side programming. I practice understanding the database-server and server-client communication. I also practice writing commit history. 

## Features
User can register to the secrets app or log in to the app. If logged in, user will see a secret if one exists in database or user can add a new secret to replace the old one.  

## Entry point
The main entry point of the solution is the index.js file
